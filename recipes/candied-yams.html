      Although there's no rule against making candied yams any time you want,
      there are three times a year when candied yam recipes reach their peak
      popularity: Thanksgiving by far leads the way, with Christmas and Easter
      coming in a distant second and third. So, it's safe to say that if you're
      making candied yams, it's probably for a holiday feast. And with all the
      prep and cooking that goes into the holidays, it's no surprise that our
      Allrecipes home cooks appreciate an easy four-ingredient recipe like
      Candied Yams as a no-fuss side dish to round out their special holiday
      menus.
